# MemInspector

MemInspector is a command-line tool that allows you to monitor and modify the memory of a target process. You can also inject a custom DLL into the target process, providing real-time monitoring of its memory modifications. Additionally, you can enter commands to read and write to the process's memory, giving you more control over a particular value in memory.

<u>Note</u>: MemInspector is currently in development. The program is not thoroughly tested and may contain bugs or stability issues.
